Genetic Groups
==========

The problem to be solved in this programming exercise is to improve the heterogeneity of learning groups by forming groups with learners who have heterogeneous personality attributes.

The process involvles analyzing and fine-tuning this Genetic algorithm to achieve the best possible results.

Valid Groups
----------
The following requirements have to be fulfilled in order to form a valid group:

1. The group has to consist of four students.
2. Each student can only belong to one group.
3. The GH of each group must be greater than 0.5.
4. The Euclidean distance between at least two of the students in a group must be greater than 2.0.

Output File
----------
An output file of your algorithm will include:

- membersofthegroup(ID)
- GHofeachgroup
- highest Euclidean distance of each group 
- sumofallGHvalues
